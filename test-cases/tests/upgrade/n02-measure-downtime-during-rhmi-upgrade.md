# N02 - Measure downtime during RHMI upgrade

## Description

Mesure the downtime of the RHMI components during the RHMI upgrade (not to be confused with the OpenShift upgrade) to ensure RHMI can be safely upgraded.

**Note:** The steps 1. and 2. should be executed before the upgrade, and the rest of the steps after the upgrade

## Prerequisites

- Node.js installed locally
- [ocm CLI](https://github.com/openshift-online/ocm-cli/releases) installed locally
- [jq v1.6](https://github.com/stedolan/jq/releases) installed locally

## Steps

1. Login via `oc` as a user with **cluster-admin** role (kubeadmin):

   ```
   oc login --token=<TOKEN> --server=https://api.<CLUSTER_NAME>.s1.devshift.org:6443
   ```

2. Clone [delorean](https://github.com/integr8ly/delorean) repo and run the `measure-downtime.js` script:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/integr8ly/delorean
   cd delorean/scripts/ocm
   node measure-downtime.js
   ```

3. Trigger the upgrade of RHMI on the cluster following the N04 test case

4. In a separate terminal, login to the ocm staging environment and get the ID of the cluster that is going to be upgraded:

   ```bash
   # Get the token at https://qaprodauth.cloud.redhat.com/openshift/token
   ocm login --url=https://api.stage.openshift.com --token=<YOUR-TOKEN>
   CLUSTER_ID=$(ocm cluster list | grep <CLUSTER-NAME> | awk '{print $1}')
   ```

5. Poll cluster to check when the RHMI upgrade is completed (update version to match currently tested version (e.g. `2.4.0`)):

   ```bash
   watch -n 60 " oc get rhmi rhmi -n redhat-rhmi-operator -o json | jq -r .status.version | grep -q "2.x.x" && echo 'RHMI Upgrade completed\!'"
   ```

   > This script will run every 60 seconds to check whether the RHMI upgrade has finished
   >
   > Once it's finished, it should print out "Upgrade completed!"

6. Go to the OpenShift console, go through all the `redhat-rhmi-` prefixed namespaces and verify that all routes (Networking -> Routes) of RHMI components are accessible

   > If some of the routes are not accessible, try again later. If they won't come up in the end, report the issue.

7. Terminate the process for measuring the downtime of components in terminal window #1

   > It takes couple of seconds until all results are collected
   >
   > The results will be written down to the file `downtime.json`

8. Upload that file to the JIRA ticket

9. Consult the results with engineering (especially in case some components have a long downtime or are not working properly)
